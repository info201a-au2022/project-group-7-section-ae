###Abstract: Our main question is “How do salaries vary across different sporting leagues and is it ethical?” This question is important because we want to further understand as a group how athletes are being paid and what it is based on. To address the question, we will take data from across all sporting leagues in the US (NFL, NHL, MLB, NBA) and compare and contrast them with each other to make a statistical conclusion. 

###Keywords: salaries; equality; sporting leagues

###Introduction 
Our project is to analyze and compare statistics on how salaries vary between different sports leagues and determine whether it is equal or not. We are using a Sports League Dataset made by  Bastos, André A.; Salim, Matheus O. Brandão, Wladmir C.. This data set was created on June 25th 2019 and thus the sports data is from that year. Our main goal is to  pull data from each sporting league folder (NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL) specifically outlining salaries and then compare how they differ from each sport. We will be basing our final explanation off of how well the teams overall performance is and where the team is located to measure how its proximity to a major city will affect their salaries. We hope to come to a conclusion on whether the salaries given to players across the leagues are fair and equitable for all players in the sporting leagues.

TOPIC SUMMARY

Our topic is talking about the pay differences among individuals and different sport leagues such as the NBA, NFL, and MLB. The frame is to compare and analyze these differences to see how they affect individuals athletic performance, statistics, and rankings. The analysis will also include comparing the average salaries among leagues to see how that affects attendees at games and the quality of teams.

STAKEHOLDERS

The direct stakeholders in this project are the individual athletes as these are the people that get paid, in which that affects a number of variables such as performance, attendance, and motivation. Other direct stakeholders are the individual team executives. These are the people that give out salaries and paychecks, sign deals etc.

The indirect stakeholders would be sport league executives, and sport event attendees. The league executives plan out events, organize teams, and create schedules for teams to follow. All these affect teams and individual athletes. Sport event attendees are indirect stakeholders because they are the ones that pay players salaries, they may bet on teams etc. Individual athletes and teams performance may affect sport event attendees' views on the teams and affect whether or not they would want to watch a game of the team in the future.

HARMS AND BENEFITS OF SALARIES

Benefits of a high salary may include increased performance, better overall health due to better healthcare, better overall livelihood. All these factors and more will impact teams performance. 
Harms of a low salary may include most of the opposite of a high salary such as lower health, lower performance, and worse livelihood.
###Research Questions 
1) From the preconceived notions of the general population of sports fans, factors such as ad revenue, funding, and general popularity are thought to be the most significant influencers of team salaries. Does the data support or counter these notions, and what can this say about the views of sports fans?

2) An issue that has been in its limelight in recent years is the inequality of salaries between male and female athletes of the same sports. If there are discrepancies in salaries between different men’s sports, how do these differences compare to those between male and female salaries, and thus, which is more of an issue?

3) In recent years, there have been multiple additions to leagues in the form of new sports teams, likely owned and funded by wealthy individuals. How do the salaries of these newer sports teams compare to those of older teams across the same sports?

4) The location of a sports team can largely influence the team due to its proximity to a populus area or city and the demographic of the population. To what extent can the location influence the total salaries of sports teams based on these factors?

###The Dataset
The dataset covers the total team salaries of sports teams from 4 different sports leagues in the United States: the MLB, NBA, NHL, and NFL. This data includes salary data from the years 2000 to 2017, and includes data on new and past teams in each of the leagues Lastly, the data set includes the salary cap of the nba throughout the years which can serve as a baseline to compare the data. The data can serve as a baseline to answer all of the research questions, as it can compare salaries between teams from the same sport as well as salaries between sports. However, it will be necessary to find data from outside sources such as that of the funding and popularity of each league and the comparable salaries of women’s sports. In terms of the project domain, we will investigate how the data will affect each of the direct and indirect stakeholders, and how the harms and benefits relate to leagues and teams with higher or lower salaries.

4. 
  a) The data was collected by Andre Bastos, Matheus Salim, and Wladmir Brandao in 2019 from Forbes, Spotrac, and Sports Reference. The data was collected in           order to make this data easily accessible and comparable on a large scale for sports fans or those wishing to conduct projects on the data. 
  b) The data collection for the dataset by Bastos, Salim, and Brandao was likely not funded, but the original collectors of the data (Forbe, Spotrac, and              Sports Reference) are all for-profit companies, so by accessing their website users are giving them data and allowing them to gain ad revenue. The leagues            themselves, and their sponsors are most likely to benefit on a larger basis because people that discover and use this dataset may be compelled to start               watching these sports.
  c) The data is validated because it was collected from three reliable sources that are largely followed by sports fans interested in sports statistics.
  d)  We obtained this data from the dataset website zenodo, and we cited the source of the data above.

###Expected Implications

There are a lot of expected/possible implicaitons we can make based on our research questions and data. We can imply that the more ad revenue, fan attendance and general publicity a team gets the more the team's salary will be. Another implication we can make is that when an owner sells a team, and a new owner takes over a team the overall team's salary will be higher as they will overpay players to come play for their new team and also have more funding. Another expected implication is that when a sports team relocates from a smaller market area to a larger market area, this will cause the profits of the team to be higher, resulting in the overall team's salary becoming a higher quantity. Regarding policy in the city, teams that are located in places with higher taxes may have a higher team salary as they would likely need to give players more money in order to compensate for what they would be losing to taxes. 

###Limitations 

Some limitations that we might come across are our ability to fully analyze the data to heart, as we are looking at the team’s salary, however when comparing this across different sports leagues it can be hard to compare as there can be a lot of context to why the certain sports team salary is at a certain amount. One of these reasons could be the wealth of the owner of the team, as teams with a wealthy owner have more money to spend on their team's salary and go into what is called the “luxury tax”. This term refers to when a team spends past the leagues cap on salaries. Another factor to account for is that some teams field a worse team on purpose to save their money for when a major player becomes a free agent, resulting in a lower team salary compared to other teams. Lastly, the length of the season may cause some variability between sports, as some seasons arelonger so players would receive more compensatiion. Overall, the data that we receive is just a surface level look into the pay difference between sport leagues.
